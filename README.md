## Problem Statement

Small businesses require an easier way to interface with new and existing customers.

## How Might We?

How might we help our users manage their finances easier , while being a foreigner? How might we inform visiting parties about areas to go to or activities to participate in while on vacation? How might we help small businesses improve the amount of customers they reach and serve? How might we help small businesses improve their presence on mobile and social media?

## Objective

To give small businesses and places of interest the opportunity to have better advertisements and recognition among the general public and tourists. Main focus of this website application is to promote small business to locals and tourists so that they can sustain themselves in this competitive world full of large corporations who leave no stone unturned to crush these small business.

## Background

The “Pree” web application helps users by informing them of various activities, services, and goods that are being offered to them by local merchants. This application also allows users to pay for said goods, services, and activities by utilizing the secure and efficient JAD API/PayPal API, that will prevent them from going through the hassle of converting their current money into local cash currency , and instead will handle all payment electronically.

Our new service that we plan to implement will: Be advantageous over competitors like Yelp, Grubhub, and Craigslist Have a user base of tourists, and locals of developing markets

This service came about after observing a need for such service in Jamaica, where locals and tourists, are unaware of activities, services, and goods around them. At the moment, they also lack a secure way of electronic payment.

## Overview

After completing the “Empathize” and “Ideation” phases of project development, our team came up with the idea of creating a service, called Pree, that would offer locals in, and tourists visiting developing countries, to aid them in there time spent in the country. We will also be utilizing the PayPal API to help users securely pay for goods and services during their time. The service will first start as a web application , as users on average, use their computers to book trips. After the web service is completed, we will begin work on a mobile application, for Android devices.
